## Remarkable projects
### [Client Prioritization with Arca Continental](https://github.com/JuanBernal1012/Portafolio/tree/main/Ago_Dic_2024/Inteligencia_Artificial_Avanzada_IA_2/Reto_TC3007C)
- Developed an AI model to predict the success of new products in the market based on historical sales data and
customer demographics for Arca Continental.

- Implemented Natural Language Processing (Vector Embeddings, Jaccard Similarity) to reduce product data
dimensionality.

- Used Cosine Similarity and weighted key metrics to predict the most compatible customers for a new product.

- Evaluated the model with customized metrics, achieving 0.4 accuracy in predicting potential buyers.

- Proposed an improvement through a feedback-based system to optimize model precision.

### [Sales Prediction App](https://github.com/JuanBernal1012/Portafolio/tree/main/Ago_Dic_2023/Optimizacion_Estocastica)
- Cleaned and standardized a 7-million-entry database to ensure data accuracy and usability.

- Developed a Markov Chain model to calculate product purchase probabilities using client history, providing
actionable insights for sales predictions.

### [Class Scheduling Problem](https://github.com/JuanBernal1012/Portafolio/tree/main/Ene_Jun_2023/Optimizacion_Determinista)
- Developed an efficient linear mathematical model for scheduling up to 30 professors across 20 courses and 35 classrooms for the ITESM Guadalajara Science Department.

- Optimized faculty allocation by minimizing the number of required professors while ensuring compliance with workload constraints.

- Implemented the model using Python and leveraged Gurobi for mathematical optimization.

### [Mars Rover Exploration](https://github.com/JuanBernal1012/Portafolio/tree/main/Ene_Jun_2023/Dise%C3%B1o_Agentes_Inteligentes)
- Developed pathfinding algorithms for a Mars topographic map utilizing AI search algorithms.

- Implemented search algorithms including A* and Simulated Annealing for path optimization in digitalized Mars maps.

- Conducted comparative analysis of algorithm performance to evaluate efficiency and accuracy in navigating complex terrains.

- Visualized routes and terrain data with heatmaps for precise navigation using Matplotlib and Seaborn.

### [Song Recognition System](https://github.com/josecyamuni/song-recognizer)
- Developed a song identification system using STFT and peak detection to create constellation maps of audio.

- Generated unique audio hashes for database storage and fast lookup of songs.

- Implemented a score-based matching algorithm to compare input song hashes with the database.

- Built a real-time recognition UI with Streamlit to allow users to identify songs through an interactive interface

### [Discrete Bayesian Model for Predicting the Most Used Mode of Transportation](https://github.com/JuanBernal1012/Portafolio/tree/main/Ago_Dic_2023/Metodos_Razonamiento_Incertidumbre/Red_Bayesiana_Discreta)
- Implemented discrete Bayesian networks in R to study the usage patterns of different modes of transportation and the main reasons behind their use.

- Generated DAGs for causal data analysis, enabling decision-making queries to uncover the reasons behind the preference for certain transportation modes.

### [Continuous Bayesian Model for Estimating Body Levels](https://github.com/JuanBernal1012/Portafolio/tree/main/Ago_Dic_2023/Metodos_Razonamiento_Incertidumbre/Red_Bayesiana_Continua)
- Applied continuous Bayesian networks to analyze continuous variables in the context of health and chronic kidney disease (CKD).

- Proposed a network structure based on a DAG to represent hypothetical relationships between body variables influencing CKD.

- Adjusted a Gaussian Bayesian Network (GBN) using a hospital database and evaluated the network's goodness-of-fit through Bayesian information criteria.

- My model reveals the probabilities associated with natural body levels indicating symptoms of CKD.
